# Module 1 Challenge - Horiseon

## Description
The purpose of the challenge was givento refactor html code from an end user and bring it up to accessability standards. We also had to review the HTML code and CSS styling sheet and correct errors and add comments where it was needed. I found it quite difficult as I have no expereince of coding and it took me a while. It made me realise that I need to do a lot of extra work to help myself learn. Challenge Accepted!
